# E2E test configuration
#
# This config is used by the end-to-end tests. It targets the local AI stack
# (Qdrant + Ollama) and expects them to be running before tests start.
#
# GitHub token is NOT stored here — it's resolved at test time from:
#   1. GITHUB_TOKEN env var (preferred)
#   2. Host machine's ~/.ossgard/config.toml (fallback)
