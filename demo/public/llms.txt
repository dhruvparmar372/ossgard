> AI-powered duplicate pull request detection for open-source repositories.

ossgard is a CLI tool and API server that scans GitHub repositories to find duplicate pull requests. It uses embedding-based similarity search combined with LLM-powered pairwise verification to identify PRs that address the same issue, implement the same feature, or fix the same bug.

## How It Works

1. **Ingest**: Fetches all open PRs from a GitHub repository
2. **Embed**: Extracts intent summaries and code signals, then computes embeddings for each PR
3. **Verify**: Uses LLM pairwise comparison to confirm candidate duplicate pairs
4. **Rank**: Groups confirmed duplicates and ranks them by code quality, completeness, and test coverage

## Key Features

- Detects duplicate PRs using dual-signal analysis (code paths + intent)
- Ranks duplicates by quality so maintainers know which PR to merge
- Provides LLM-generated rationale for each ranking decision
- Supports batch processing for cost-efficient scanning of large repos
- CLI-first with optional API server for automation

## Use Cases

- Open-source maintainers reviewing large PR backlogs
- Finding redundant contributions across hundreds of open PRs
- Identifying which of several similar PRs has the best implementation
- Reducing reviewer fatigue by surfacing duplicate work early
